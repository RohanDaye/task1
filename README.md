Initialization:

The code starts by importing necessary classes (Scanner for user input and Random for generating random numbers).
It defines the Task1 class and the main method.
Game Settings:

It sets up variables for the game, such as the lower and upper bounds for the target number, the maximum number of attempts allowed, the number of rounds played, and the player's score.
Game Loop:

The code enters a while loop (while (playAgain)) that allows the player to play the game multiple times until they choose not to play again.
Generate Target Number:

Inside the loop, a random number (targetNumber) within the specified range is generated, and the player is prompted to guess a number between the lower and upper bounds.
Guessing Mechanism:

Another while loop handles the guessing mechanism, allowing the player to input guesses within a limited number of attempts.
The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and prompts the user to try again.
Game Outcome:

If the player correctly guesses the number within the allowed attempts, a success message is displayed, the score is incremented, and the loop breaks.
If the maximum number of attempts is reached, the correct number is revealed.
Play Again Prompt:

After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again. The loop continues if the player chooses "yes" and terminates if they choose "no" or any other input.
Game Summary:

After the player decides not to play again, the code prints a summary, including the player's score (number of successful rounds) and the total number of rounds played.
Closing Resources:

The Scanner is closed to prevent resource leaks.
